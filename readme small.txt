Hello and welcome! :) 

In order to run this program you will need to run Exec.py 
and thats all ! YES. It asks you for everything you might want.

DEPENDENCIES:
>urllib
>requests
>numpy
>cv2
And the standard python modules like:
>json, random, string , os,itertools 



Things you should do manually:
-Check your pics for duplicates, the API is after all free so it has a limited amount of resources

Things you can do manually: 
-add the Exec.py to your windows startup directory and enable it to run on startup, or if you want to post hourly just remove the input variable and switch it with time-seperated pick. For example : Post a dog, 1hour wait, post a cat, 1hour wait, clean up downloaded pictures, 1hour wait, post a dog, 1 hour wait... You get the point.


But Why didnt you automate it ??? 
-Cause its less stable, its easy to automate it at this point, but it isnt as monitored, and plus i dont even need a bot running all the time on my PC.
